III. Research Interests
======
The research interests of Dr. Wang are the design and application of embedded magnetic encoder. The embedded magnetic encoder (EME) is a novel sensor which achieves highly compact detection of rotor position by inserting several linear Hall sensors in PMSM’s cavity. Given that the EME locates inside the PMSM and provides rotor information for controller, the EME is actually complicated and coupled system including magnetic design, control algorithm, electromagnetic interference, thermal effect, rotor eccentricity, demagnetization, and so on. With the help of EME, the PMSM can save the volume for installing conventional mechanical rotary device and release the complexity of structure design. Invoked by EME system, the design of overall motor drive system should comprehensive consider electric machine, rotary device, and controller, which is also the trend of both academic research and industrial applications. The future research covers the area of:
* Application of EME in novel machine topologies and ultra-high speed machine
* Advanced control based on in EME system
* Health monitoring and diagnostics of electric machine based on EME
* The crucial problem in integration electrical machine drive system (EMI/Thermal problems)


IV. Skill
